"""
Modifiable Items Attribute Dictionary and related objects.

This module provides the `ModifiableItemsAttrDict` class which extends the
`ModifiableItemsDict` class from the `modifiable_items_dictionary` module.
This class allows for attribute-style access to dictionary items.

Objects provided by this module:
   `ModifiableItemsAttrDict` - Adds the ability to access dictionary items
   as attributes.

Reference:
This module was heavily inspired by Raymond Hettinger's class.
